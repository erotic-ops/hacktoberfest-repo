# How to contribute to this project

### Create a `Hello, World!` Script

Add a `hello_world_yourusername.xx` script to the `scripts` directory in any language of your choice! Here is an example:

```Javascript
// LANGUAGE: Javascript
// ENV: Node.js
// AUTHOR: Anmol Agarwal
// GITHUB: https://github.com/fineanmol

console.log('Hello, World!');
```

Name the file `hello_world_yourusername.xx`. e.g., `hello_world_loper.js` or `hello_world_loper.py`.

Add your scripts to the specific folder for specific languages created.

Don't forget to include the comments as seen above. Feel free to include additional information about the language you choose in your comments too! Like a link to a helpful introduction or tutorial.
